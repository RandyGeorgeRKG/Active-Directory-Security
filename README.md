Talking Point: Discuss the importance of a secure domain controller setup, including physical security, least privilege access, and patch management. Mention configuring it as a baseline for centralized authentication and policy management.
## Group Policy Implementation
Screenshot: Group Policy Management Console showing applied policies (e.g., password policies, account lockout settings, or software restriction policies).
Talking Point: Highlight how Group Policies enforce security baselines, such as ensuring strong password enforcement and reducing attack surface.
##  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Screenshot: Organizational Units (OUs) and security groups structure in AD Users and Computers.
Talking Point: Explain the implementation of RBAC to minimize excessive permissions and implement the principle of least privilege effectively.
##  Monitoring and Auditing Logs
Screenshot: Event Viewer or audit logs showing login attempts, account lockouts, or other AD events.
Talking Point: Emphasize how monitoring and auditing are crucial for detecting unauthorized access and meeting compliance requirements.
##  Security Hardening
Screenshot: AD security settings or PowerShell script outputs demonstrating disabled unnecessary services, implemented SMB signing, or enabled LDAPS.
Talking Point: Detail steps taken to harden the AD environment against common attack vectors like Pass-the-Hash or Kerberos ticket attacks.
